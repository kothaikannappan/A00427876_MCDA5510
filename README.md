I'm Kothai Kannappan Murugappan ( A00427876 ) from India. I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm fairly good at object oriented concepts and java, but yet to explore .Net and c#. So, it would be great, if the sessions starts these languages from the scratch. 
My preferred mail id is kannappan1995.kk@gmail.com
